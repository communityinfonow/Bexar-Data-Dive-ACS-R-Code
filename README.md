# ACS-R-Code
Example ACS R code that we used to pull data for Bexar Data Dive.
The "ACS_Age_R Code" file shows the code used to pull the "Age" indicator from the American Community Survey using RStudio.
The folders "Council District crosswalk", "SSA crosswalk," and "List of ZIP Codes" are used to aggregate data
to the Council District, SSA, and ZIP Code level.
